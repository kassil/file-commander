This is my file manager inspired by Norton Commander

User interface
- Arrow up/down keys to navigate directories
- Enter to change directory
- 'q' to quit

Features
- Displays a debug window on the left half of the terminal
- Shows directory contents on the right half of the terminal

Details
- Handles terminal resizing
- Shows current path at the top of the directory view
- Highlights the selected entry
- Navigate to parent directory with ".." entry
- Error handling for directory reading

This is a basic implementation and can be extended with more features
such as file operations, multiple panes, etc.
